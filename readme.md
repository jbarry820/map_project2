# Project Title

Neighborhood Map Project

## Getting Started

* These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes:
* Go to git@github.com:jbarry820/map_project2.git to get the project.
* Clone this to your machine.
* Edit in your Sublime or your choice of editor.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them
* You will need Sublime Text Editor or an editor of your choice.
* You will need either a localhost web server or a regular web server to host the program

### Installing

* For deployment, copy all subdirectories and files to your web server and start the program with the index.html file in the root of the main directory.

## Running the program

* After index.html has loaded, click on one of the side items in the list and the map will zoom to that location.

* You can also type in the name of a location and if it is valid, the map will zoom to that location.

* When you zoom to a location, you can then click on the marker and the name of the apiary and a picture from flicker.com will appear.

## Contributing

* William Barry* who is a programmer at the Nine Agency in Tuscaloosa, Alabama was my tutor. He helped me in particular with ```dividing the program up into several files rather than one large file```. He also showed me how to ```get the picture from flickr.com to pop up when the marker of the apiary is clicked```.
